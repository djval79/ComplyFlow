## 3. Email Campaigns

### Email 1: Cold Outreach to Care Home Directors
**Subject:** CQC Inspection readiness (and your Sunday evenings)

Hi [Name],

I'm hearing from a lot of Registered Managers that the new CQC Single Assessment Framework is adding massive pressure to their workload.

We built **ComplyFlow** to fix this. It’s an AI platform that:
1.  **Instantly spots gaps** in your policies before an inspector does.
2.  **Automates Visa tracking** (protecting your sponsor license).
3.  **Runs Mock Inspections** so your team isn't caught off guard.

We’re already helping 147+ UK care homes avoid penalties (avg £12k saved) and get their weekends back.

Would you be open to a 5-minute demo to see how we’d handle your next mock inspection?

Best,

[Your Name]  
Head of Partnerships, ComplyFlow

### Email 2: User Welcome / Onboarding Logic
**Subject:** Welcome to ComplyFlow - Let's get you CQC-proof

Hi [Name],

Great to have you on board. You’ve just taken the first step towards a stress-free inspection.

To get the most out of your trial, I recommend doing these two things today:
1.  **Run a Gap Analysis:** Upload your current Safeguarding policy and let our AI tell you exactly what’s missing.
2.  **Check your Sponsor Status:** Add your first worker to the Visa Tracker to ensure you never miss an expiry date.

Here to help if you need anything.

Cheers,  
The ComplyFlow Team

## 4. Social Media (LinkedIn Focus)

### Post 1: The "Fear" Angle (Compliance)
🛑 **The most expensive mistake a Care Home can make?**

Ignoring "minor" policy gaps.

We analyzed 100+ "Requires Improvement" reports. The common denominator? Outdated documentation that didn't match the new CQC framework.

You don't need expensive consultants to fix this. You need intelligent oversight.

ComplyFlow's **AI Gap Analyzer** reads your policies like an inspector would—*before* they walk through the door.

👉 Fix your gaps today: [Link]

### Post 2: The "Sponsorship" Angle
🇬🇧 **Sponsoring overseas care workers?**

The Home Office is cracking down on compliance. One missed right-to-work check can cost you your license.

Don't use sticky notes. Don't use messy spreadsheets.

Use **SponsorGuardian** by ComplyFlow. Automated alerts, document storage, and peace of mind. 

Protect your workforce. Protect your business.
