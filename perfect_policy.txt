Our organisation is committed to safe care. We ensure all staff follow the Mental Capacity Act and always act in the best interest of service users.
Safeguarding is a priority; we have a clear whistleblowing policy for reporting abuse to the local authority.
We use MAR charts for all medication administration and have strict disposal logs.
All staff undergo DBS checks before employment.
